  Reinforcement Learning to RankPublished on May 20·Submitted byTianheWuon May 21Upvote26+18Authors:Tianhe Wu,Jian Zou,Jie Liang,Lei Zhang,Kede MaDeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in incentivizing
reasoning and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
throughreinforcement learning. Nevertheless, the potential of
reasoning-induced computational modeling has not been thoroughly explored in
the context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task critically dependent on
visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, areasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA)model, and we train it withreinforcement learningto rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the
intrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of
images, we employgroup relative policy optimizationto generate multiple
quality scores for each image. These estimates are then used to compute
comparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other
under theThurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined usingcontinuous fidelity measuresrather than discretized binary labels. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed VisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms
discriminative deep learning-based NR-IQA models as well as a recent
reasoning-induced quality regression method. Moreover, VisualQuality-R1 is
capable of generating contextually rich, human-aligned quality descriptions,
and supports multi-dataset training without requiring perceptual scale
realignment. These features make VisualQuality-R1 especially well-suited for
reliably measuring progress in a wide range of image processing tasks likesuper-resolutionandimage generation.View arXiv pageView PDFGitHub repositoryAdd to collectionCommunityTianheWuPaper authorPaper submitterabout 20 hours agoThis comment has been hidden (marked as Abuse)TianheWuPaper authorPaper submitterabout 16 hours ago•edited about 16 hours agoThe first NR-IQA model enhanced by RL2R, capable of both quality description and rating through reasoning.
