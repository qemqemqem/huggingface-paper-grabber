reasoning to solve tasks like visual reasoning. However, standard NeSy
predictors assumeconditional independencebetween the symbols they extract,
thus limiting their ability to model interactions and uncertainty - often
leading to overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution
generalisation. To overcome the limitations of the independence assumption, we
introduce neurosymbolic diffusion models (NeSyDMs), a new class of NeSy
predictors that usediscrete diffusionto model dependencies between symbols.
Our approach reuses the independence assumption from NeSy predictors at each
step of the diffusion process, enabling scalable learning while capturingsymbol dependenciesanduncertainty quantification. Across both synthetic andreal-world benchmarks- includinghigh-dimensional visual path planningandrule-based autonomous driving- NeSyDMs achievestate-of-the-art accuracyamong
NeSy predictors and demonstratestrong calibration.View arXiv pageView PDFProject pageGitHub repositoryAdd to collectionCommunityHEmilePaper authorPaper submitterabout 15 hours agoWe integrated neurosymbolic (NeSy) methods with discrete diffusion models.Diffusion for discrete data is massively successful: Just yesterday, Google announced a diffusion LLM!We find diffusion is especially compelling for NeSy, combining powerful visual understanding with symbolic reasoning ðŸš€Code athttps://github.com/HEmile/neurosymbolic-diffusionSee translationðŸ”¥55+ReplyEditPreviewUpload images, audio, and videos by dragging in the text input, pasting, orclicking here.Tap or paste here to upload imagesCommentÂ·Sign uporlog into comment
