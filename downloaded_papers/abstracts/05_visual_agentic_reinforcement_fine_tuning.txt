agentic ability to use external tools such as web browsers for searching and
writing/executing code for image manipulation to think with images. In the
open-source research community, while significant progress has been made in
language-only agentic abilities such as function calling and tool integration,
the development of multi-modal agentic capabilities that involve truly thinking
with images, and their corresponding benchmarks, are still less explored. This
work highlights the effectiveness ofVisual Agentic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning(Visual-ARFT) for enabling flexible and adaptive reasoning abilities for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With Visual-ARFT, open-source LVLMs gain the
ability to browse websites for real-time information updates and write code to
manipulate and analyze input images through cropping, rotation, and other image
processing techniques. We also present aMulti-modal Agentic Tool Bench(MAT)
with two settings (MAT-SearchandMAT-Coding) designed to evaluate LVLMs'
agentic search and coding abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that
Visual-ARFT outperforms its baseline by +18.6% F1 / +13.0% EM onMAT-Codingand
+10.3% F1 / +8.7% EM onMAT-Search, ultimately surpassing GPT-4o. Visual-ARFT
also achieves +29.3 F1% / +25.9% EM gains on existingmulti-hop QA benchmarkssuch as 2Wiki and HotpotQA, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.
Our findings suggest that Visual-ARFT offers a promising path toward building
robust and generalizable multimodal agents.View arXiv pageView PDFGitHub repositoryAdd to collectionCommunitymyownskyW7Paper authorPaper submitterabout 18 hours agoCode is available athttps://github.com/Liuziyu77/Visual-RFT/tree/main/Visual-ARFTSee translationüëç11+ReplyEditPreviewUpload images, audio, and videos by dragging in the text input, pasting, orclicking here.Tap or paste here to upload imagesComment¬∑Sign uporlog into comment
